OTM interpolation in high-contrast computational caustic design involves performing interpolation using the Optimal-Transport Model (OTM). The specific steps and code examples for this process are not provided in the given search results. However, I can provide a general outline of the steps involved in performing OTM interpolation:

1.  Load the source image and target image: In the caustic-design project, the source image and target image are required for OTM interpolation. The source image represents the initial state, and the target image represents the desired state. These images can be loaded either via code or through the UI. In the code, you would uncomment the lines that load the images and replace the file paths with the actual paths to the images.

2.  Configure the interpolation parameters: The interpolation process may require configuring certain parameters such as the amount of sites and multi-scale levels. These parameters can typically be set in a configuration file, such as the `config.h` file in the caustic-design project.

3.  Compute the interpolation: Once the images are loaded and the parameters are configured, the interpolation process can be performed. This involves running the OTM interpolation algorithm on the source image, along with the points and weights data obtained from the OTM. The specific code for computing the interpolation is not provided in the search results, but it may involve using libraries such as CGAL (Computational Geometry Algorithms Library) for performing natural neighbor interpolation.

4.  Obtain the interpolated result: After the interpolation is computed, you can obtain the interpolated result, which represents the transformation of the source image towards the target image. The specific process for obtaining the result may depend on the implementation details of the caustic-design project.

It's worth noting that the search results provided only offer limited information on the specific steps and code examples for OTM interpolation in high-contrast computational caustic design. To get a more detailed understanding and specific code examples, it would be helpful to refer to the original research papers and documentation related to the caustic-design project.

#### Phind
To implement the Optimal Transport Model (OTM) interpolation in Julia, you can use the OptimalTransport.jl package. This package provides algorithms for solving optimal transport problems in Julia [(1)](https://github.com/JuliaOptimalTransport/).

To install the OptimalTransport.jl package, you can use the following command in the Julia REPL:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("OptimalTransport")
```

Once you have installed the package, you can use the provided functions and algorithms to perform OTM interpolation. Here's an example of how to use the package:

```julia
using OptimalTransport

# Define the source and target densities
source_density = [0.2, 0.3, 0.5]
target_density = [0.4, 0.1, 0.5]

# Compute the optimal transport interpolation
interpolation = optimal_transport_interpolation(source_density, target_density)

# Print the interpolated densities
println("Interpolated densities:")
for i in 1:length(interpolation)
    println("Point $i: $(interpolation[i])")
end
```

This code defines the source and target densities as arrays and then uses the `optimal_transport_interpolation` function from the OptimalTransport.jl package to compute the interpolated densities. The interpolated densities are then printed using a loop.

Note that this is a simple example and the actual implementation may vary depending on your specific use case. You can refer to the package documentation and examples for more information on how to use the OptimalTransport.jl package [(1)](https://github.com/JuliaOptimalTransport/).

Additionally, if you're interested in other aspects of optimal transport, such as optimization algorithms or stochastic optimization, there are other packages available in Julia that you can explore, such as Optim.jl and StochasticOptimalTransport.jl [(0)](https://www.juliapackages.com/p/optim) [(2)](https://github.com/JuliaOptimalTransport/StochasticOptimalTransport.jl).

I hope this helps you get started with implementing the Optimal Transport Model (OTM) interpolation in Julia!

**final task:** Implement the algorithms described in the research paper 'High-contrast Computational Caustic Design' in Julia, starting with the OTM interpolation.
**executive summary:** The task involves implementing the algorithms described in the research paper 'High-contrast Computational Caustic Design' in Julia. The paper presents a new algorithm for designing caustic images produced by refracted light. The algorithm solves for the shape of a transparent object that will create a desired caustic image on a receiver screen. The approach uses an optimal transport formulation to establish a correspondence between the input geometry and the target shape, followed by a 3D optimization based on an adaptive discretization scheme to find the target surface. The algorithm supports piecewise smooth surfaces and non-bijective mappings, allowing for a richer variety of caustic images with smooth transitions, singularities of infinite light density, and completely black areas. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulated and fabricated examples.\\n\\nThe first step in the implementation process is to perform OTM interpolation. This can be done using the OptimalTransport.jl package in Julia. The package provides algorithms for solving optimal transport problems, which can be used to perform the interpolation. The interpolated densities can then be used to compute the transformation of the source image towards the target image. The specific implementation details may vary depending on the specific use case and the details provided in the research paper.


#### Phind
To implement the algorithms described in the `High-Contrast Computational Caustic Design` research paper, we would use Julia language. Julia has a package called `OptimalTransport` which provides an efficient implementation of algorithms for solving optimal transport problems.

As the first part is to implement the Optimal Transport Model (OTM) interpolation, here are the steps you could follow:

1.  First, ensure you have installed the `OptimalTransport` package. If it isn't installed yet, you can add it as follows:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("OptimalTransport")
```

2.  Now, let's assume we have two 1-dimensional discrete distributions, `mu` and `nu`. Your problem may require 2-dimensional or 3-dimensional distributions. The process would remain the same though the data and cost matrix preparation would be different. In this example, let's assume `mu` is the source light pattern and `nu` is the target light pattern. We create random densities to resemble these patterns:

3.  The Optimal Transport problem requires a cost matrix `C` where `C[i, j]` is the cost of transporting mass from the i-th point of the source to the j-th point of the target. It depends on your problem how to construct this matrix. Here's an example which simply uses the Euclidean distance:

4.  TOMI Implementation: For solving the optimal transport problem, the common solvers in the `OptimalTransport` package are `sinkhorn`, `sinkhorn_stabilized` and `sinkhorn_epsilon_scaling`. These implement variants of Sinkhorn's algorithm which solves the Entropy Regularized Optimal Transport problem. Here, let's use `sinkhorn`.

In this example, `γ` would be the OTM interpolation result. `γ[i, j]` gives the amount of mass transported from the i-th point of `mu` to the j-th point of `nu`.

This example only demonstrates the use of `OptimalTransport` for a basic OTM interpolation. Your problem would likely require additional computation, such as additional preprocessing steps or different ways of defining `mu`, `nu`, and `C`. You also might have to adjust the regularization parameter `ε` to fit your needs.

You could also use other optimal transport algorithms provided by the library, or use this as a subroutine in more complex algorithms (like the shape optimization in the paper). Always adapt the code to the specific needs of your problem and leverage further features of the `OptimalTransport` package and Julia.

Please do remember to carefully follow the descriptions given in the original research paper when implementing it in code. And always test your implementation on known examples to ensure its correctness.

For more detailed usage of the `OptimalTransport` package, you could refer to its [documentation](https://juliaplanet.github.io/OptimalTransport.jl/stable).

Your actual implementation of the algorithms in the research paper might vary based on your specific needs and understanding of the paper.

The Fresnel mapping function is a technique used in high-contrast computational caustic design. It involves solving for the shape of a transparent object such that the refracted light creates a desired caustic image on a receiver screen. This mapping function establishes a correspondence between the input geometry and the unknown target shape, allowing for the optimization of the target surface based on the correspondence map [(0)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2601097.2601200).

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the Fresnel mapping function in high-contrast computational caustic design:

1.  Establish a correspondence map: The first step is to establish a correspondence between the input geometry and the desired caustic image. This can be done using an optimal transport formulation [(1)](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/high-contrast-computational-caustic-design-g2AxmxCDm8). The correspondence map defines how the light rays from the input geometry should refract to create the desired caustic image.

2.  Solve for the target surface: Once the correspondence map is established, a 3D optimization process is performed to find the shape of the transparent object that will refract the light rays according to the correspondence map. This optimization process is based on an adaptive discretization scheme [(1)](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/high-contrast-computational-caustic-design-g2AxmxCDm8). The goal is to find a target surface that best matches the desired caustic image.

3.  Support for piecewise smooth surfaces and non-bijective mappings: One advantage of the Fresnel mapping function is that it supports piecewise smooth surfaces and non-bijective mappings. This means that the target surface can have smooth transitions, singularities of infinite light density, and completely black areas, leading to a significantly richer space of caustic images [(1)](https://www.deepdyve.com/lp/association-for-computing-machinery/high-contrast-computational-caustic-design-g2AxmxCDm8).

To implement the Fresnel mapping function in Julia, you can follow these steps:

1.  Install the `FresnelEquations` package by running `] add FresnelEquations` in the Julia REPL.

2.  Import the `FresnelEquations` module in your code: `using FresnelEquations`.

3.  Use the provided functions to calculate the Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as the reflection and transmission amplitudes. Here's an example:

```julia
n1 = 1
n2 = 2
θ_i = deg2rad(10)
[f(n1, n2, θ_i) for f in (R_s, R_p, T_s, T_p, r_s, r_p, t_s, t_p)]
```

This will return a vector of the calculated values.

4.  Note that the transmittance `T` can be defined as `1 - R`, guaranteeing perfect energy conservation. However, this implementation can suffer from catastrophic cancellation as `R` approaches 1. Instead, the transmission coefficient `t` is used directly, meaning that conservation of energy is only accurate to numerical precision.

5.  You can also use the provided functions individually to calculate specific values. For example:

```julia
R_s(n1, n2, θ_i) + T_s(n1, n2, θ_i)
R_p(n1, n2, θ_i) + T_p(n1, n2, θ_i)
```

This will calculate the sum of the reflection and transmission coefficients for the s- and p-polarization, respectively.

For more information and examples, you can refer to the [FresnelEquations.jl](https://github.com/KronosTheLate/FresnelEquations.jl) repository.

Additionally, Julia provides the dot syntax for vectorizing functions, which can be useful for applying functions to arrays of values. You can use the `@.` macro to convert every function call, operation, and assignment in an expression into the "dotted" version. Here's an example:

```julia
Y = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]
X = similar(Y) # pre-allocate output array
@. X = sin(cos(Y)) # equivalent to X .= sin.(cos.(Y))
```

This will apply the `sin` and `cos` functions element-wise to the array `Y` and assign the result to the array `X`.

For more information on dot syntax and broadcasting in Julia, you can refer to the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/functions/).

If you need to calculate Fresnel integrals, you can use the `FresnelIntegrals.jl` package. This package provides a quick way to calculate Fresnel Integrals using the error function from the `SpecialFunctions.jl` package. Here's an example:

```julia
using FresnelIntegrals
using Plots
z = -30:0.001:30
plot(x->real(fresnelc(x)), x->real(fresnels(x)),z,legend=false)
title!("Euler Spiral")
xlabel!("C(z)")
ylabel!("S(z)")
```

This code will plot the real parts of the Fresnel cosine and sine integrals over the range of `z`.

For more information and examples, you can refer to the [FresnelIntegrals.jl](https://juliapackages.com/p/fresnelintegrals) package.

If you're interested in metaprogramming in Julia, you can check out the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/metaprogramming/). It provides advanced examples and techniques for metaprogramming in Julia.

I hope this helps you implement the Fresnel mapping function in Julia! Let me know if you have any further questions.

The Fresnel Mapping function in the context of caustics essentially forms a geometric transformation from one shape to another using the light-refracting properties described by Fresnel's equations.

However, implementing this specific function from the research paper "High-Contrast Computational Caustic Design" might require advanced geometrical and physical computations as it would need to reverse-engineer the shape required to form a certain refracted light pattern. This is beyond the scope of a simple example because it involves transforming one complex shape into another based on light refraction patterns governed by the Fresnel equations and could involve complex ray tracing or optimization work.

That being said, I can provide simple examples of how to use the basic `FresnelEquations` and `FresnelIntegrals` packages in Julia.

```julia
# Standard importing procedure afterward
using FresnelEquations
using FresnelIntegrals
```

To compute Fresnel coefficients:

```julia
n1 = 1.0  # refractive index of the first medium (e.g., air)
n2 = 1.5  # refractive index of the second medium (e.g., glass)
θ_i = deg2rad(30)  # incident angle in degrees converted to radians

coefficients = [f(n1, n2, θ_i) for f in (R_s, R_p, T_s, T_p)]  # reflection and transmission for s and p polarizations
```

The Fresnel integrals can be utilized to map from one shape to another where needed:

```julia
import Plots
z = -5:0.01:5
Plots.plot(z,
           FresnelIntegrals.fresnelc(z),
           label="fresnelc function",
           xlabel="z values",
           ylabel="fresnelc response",
           title="Fresnel c Integral Plot")

Plots.plot!(z,
            FresnelIntegrals.fresnels(z),
            label="fresnels function")
```

The above example reveals how you can utilize the `FresnelEquations` and `FresnelIntegrals` packages in Julia to compute Fresnel reflection and transmission coefficients and the cos and sine versions of the Fresnel integrals.

Remember, these implementations are standard uses of the packages, not specifically tied to the researchers' paper ("High-Contrast Computational Caustic Design"). Implementing a function from a research paper often requires an understanding of the specific algorithms and methods used in the paper.

In the paper's context, it implies constructing a Fresnel Mapping from an optimization process to determine a shape that refracts light to create a specific caustic pattern. It's a complex task that likely necessitates components of computer graphics (like ray tracing and shape optimization) alongside the fundamental understanding of the physics of light refraction.


## Phind
Implementing the Fresnel mapping function and the normal-integration function within Julia requires a couple of different steps, using various packages and mathematical concepts. Below is an approach that you can adopt:

For the Fresnel mapping, you can use the `FresnelEquations` package:


```julia
# Standard importing procedure afterward
using FresnelEquations
using FresnelIntegrals
```

Now you can calculate the Fresnel coefficients:

```julia
n1 = 1.0  # refractive index of the first medium (e.g., air)
n2 = 1.5  # refractive index of the second medium (e.g., glass)
θ_i = deg2rad(30)  # angle of incidence in degrees converted to radians

coefficients = [f(n1, n2, θ_i) for f in (R_s, R_p, T_s, T_p)]  # reflection and transmission for s and p polar```
```

As for the `normal-integration` function, it generally involves the integral of a function over a surface, weighted by the normals to that surface. Julia supports numerical integration via multiple packages such as QuadGK, Cubature, and FastGaussQuadrature depending on the complexity of your need. However, without information on the surfaces and functions involved, it's difficult to provide an exact implementation. Here is


```julia
# Run in Julia Package manager
# Standard importing procedure afterward
using QuadGK

# Define a function
f(x) = x^2

# Integrate the function from 0 to 2
result, error = quadgk(f, 0, 2)

println("The integral result is: ", result)
println("The estimated error is: ", error)
```

Again, I must stress that these functionalities do not directly map to the Fresnel mapping function discussed in the research paper, as full implementation may require ray tracing, geometrical transformations, and solving an optimization problem, all of which will add substantial complexity and will not be straightforward to implement. You may want to consider breaking down each part of the problem and approach it piece by piece. Consider pursuing some self-learning on subjects like numerical integration, ray tracing, and optimization in Julia. You'll find numerous resources and tutorials on the web that can help you take on this task.
